### Reflection 
The factory spawns a enemy game object from a prefab, currenty set to a sphere with the enemy script attached to it. A factory is a good choice because it keeps the spawning logic in one script, which in return makes it easier to edit or modify the spawning system. If i had more enemy types it would make it so i could using the same system for all of them.
